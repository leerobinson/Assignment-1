This readme file is for the LJMU Holiday Request System website that has been created by Lee Robinson.

When navigating through the website there are certain areas which are suitable for the director and certain areas suitable for the user. Following the initial logon the list of requests will be shown which is suitable for both however more suitable for the director. The requests page has a link to the show page which is more suitable for the user as when on the show page they can view if their request has been authorised or not. The add and edit pages are suitable for the users because of the nature of the system i.e. the user is the one adding or editing the requests.

There are 5 webpages called; index.html, requests.html, new.html, edit.html and show.html

Each webpage contains navigation to all of the webpages. Each webpage contains alt tags for images. Each webpage has been commented as has the CSS file.

One link on each webpage within the left column has not used "<li>" as it is paragraphed within a piece of text meaning the li tag would list it.

The colourblindimages folder contains four images of each webpage in grayscale, protanopia, deuteranopia and tritanopia.

The Fujitsu ColorDoctor was used to test the webpages. It is available to download for free from http://www.fujitsu.com/global/accessibility/assistance/cd/

Each webpage has passed the w3c validation service. The CSS file has also passed the validation service.
