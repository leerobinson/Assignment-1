This readme file is for the LJMU Holiday Request System website that has been created by Lee Robinson.

There are 5 webpages called; home.html, index.html, new.html, edit.html and show.html

Each webpage contains navigation to all of the webpages. Each webpage contains alt tags for images. Each webpage has been commented as has the CSS file.

One link on each webpage within the left column has not used "<li>" as it is paragraphed within a piece of text meaning the li tag would list it.

The colourblindimages folder contains four images of each webpage in grayscale, protanopia, deuteranopia and tritanopia.

The Fujitsu ColorDoctor was used to test the webpages. It is available to download for free from http://www.fujitsu.com/global/accessibility/assistance/cd/

Each webpage has passed the w3c validation service. The CSS file has also passed the validation service.
